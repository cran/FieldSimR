\value{
A list containing input parameters for 'AlphaSimR', which is used to simulate
  correlated genetic effects based on an unstructured model.
}
\description{
Creates a list of input parameters for
\href{https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=AlphaSimR}{'AlphaSimR'} to simulate
genetic values for multiple traits across multiple environments based on an unstructured model
for genotype-by-environment (GxE) interaction. \cr
By default, 'AlphaSimR' does not support complex models for GxE interaction. However, its
functionality to simulate correlated genetic values can be utilised for this purpose by
providing the required variance structures. \code{unstr_asr_input} is a wrapper function to
construct the variance structures required to simulate GxE interaction in 'AlphaSimR' based on
a multi-trait unstructured model. This function can handle separable and non-separable structures between traits and
environments (see below). After simulating the genetic values, the wrapper function
\link[FieldSimR]{unstr_asr_output} can be used to obtain a data frame with the relevant values.
}
\details{
\code{unstr_asr_input} can handle separable and non-separable structures between traits and
environments.
\itemize{
  \item For separable structures, provide (1) \code{T_var} & \code{E_var}, and (2)
  \code{T_cor_A} & \code{E_cor_A}.
  \item For non-separable structures, provide (1) \code{var}, and (2) \code{cor_A}. \cr
  }

\strong{Note:} 'AlphaSimR' can simulate different biological effects (see:
\href{https://gaynorr.github.io/AlphaSimR/reference/SimParam.html}{SimParam}).
\itemize{
  \item For additive traits use \code{addTraitA()}.
  \item For additive + dominance traits use \code{addTraitAD()}.
  \item For additive + epistatic traits use \code{addTraitAE()}.
  \item For additive + dominance + epistatic traits use \code{addTraitADE()}.
  }
If non-additive effects are to be simulated, check the \code{useVarA} argument of these
functions.
