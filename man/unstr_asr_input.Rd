\value{
A list containing input parameters for 'AlphaSimR', which is used to simulate
  correlated genetic effects based on an unstructured model.
}
\description{
Creates a list of simulation parameters for
\href{https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=AlphaSimR}{'AlphaSimR'} to simulate
genetic values for multiple traits in multiple environments based on an unstructured model for
genotype-by-environment (GxE) interaction. \cr
By default, 'AlphaSimR' does not support complex models for GxE interaction. However, its
functionality to simulate correlated genetic values can be utilised for this purpose by
providing the required variance structures. \code{unstr_asr_input} is a wrapper function to
construct the variance structures required to simulate GxE interaction in 'AlphaSimR' based on
an unstructured model. This function is also used in combination with the
wrapper function \link[FieldSimR]{compsym_asr_output}.
}
\details{
\code{unstr_asr_input} can handle non-separable and separable structures between traits and
environments.
\itemize{
  \item For non-separable structures, provide (1) \code{var}, and (2) \code{cor_A}.
  \item For separable structures, provide (1) \code{T_var} & \code{E_var}, and (2)
  \code{T_cor_A} & \code{E_cor_A}. \cr
  }

\strong{Note:} 'AlphaSimR' can simulate different biological effects (see:
\code{\link[AlphaSimR]{SimParam}}).
\itemize{
  \item For additive traits use \code{addTraitA()}.
  \item For additive + dominance traits use \code{addTraitAD()}.
  \item For additive + epistatic traits use \code{addTraitAE()}.
  \item For additive + dominance + epistatic traits use \code{addTraitADE()}.
  }
If non-additive effects are to be simulated, check the \code{useVarA} argument of these
functions.
