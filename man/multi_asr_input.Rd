input parameters}
\usage{
multi_asr_input(
  ntraits = 1,
  nenvs = 2,
  mean = 0,
  var = 1,
  corA = NULL,
  nterms = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{ntraits}{Number of traits to be simulated.}

\item{nenvs}{Number of environments to be simulated (minimum of two).}

\item{mean}{A vector of mean genetic values for each trait or each environment-within-trait combination.
If only one value is specified, all combinations will be assigned the same mean.}

\item{var}{A vector of additive genetic variances for each trait or each environment-within-trait combination.
If only one value is specified, all combinations will be assigned the same variance.}

\item{corA}{A matrix of additive genetic correlations between environment-within-trait
combinations. By default, a diagonal matrix is constructed.}

\item{nterms}{A scalar defining the number of multiplicative terms to be simulated. By default,
the number of terms is set to the number of environment-within-trait combinations.
\strong{Note:} when \code{nterms} is less than the number of environment-within-trait combinations,
the values in \code{mean} will be approximated.}
}
\value{
A list with input parameters for `AlphaSimR`, which are used to simulate
  correlated genetic values based on a multiplicative model for GxE interaction.
  Covariates are also supplied for use in \link[FieldSimR]{multi_asr_output}.
}
\description{
Creates a list of input parameters for
\href{https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=AlphaSimR}{`AlphaSimR`} to simulate
genetic values in multiple environments for one or more traits based on a (reduced rank)
multiplicative model for genotype-by-environment (GxE) interaction. \cr
This function utilises the ability of `AlphaSimR` to simulate correlated traits.
The wrapper function \code{multi_asr_input()} is used to specify the input parameters required in `AlphaSimR`.
After simulating the genetic values, the wrapper function \link[FieldSimR]{multi_asr_output} can be used to
generate a data frame with output values.
}
\details{
Currently supports additive traits only, but other (non-additive) traits are being implemented.

# Simulate genetic values with 'AlphaSimR' for two additive traits in two
# environments based on a multiplicative model with three terms.

# 1. Define the genetic architecture of the simulated traits.

# Additive genetic variances.
