\arguments{
\item{n_envs}{Number of environments to be simulated. A minimum of two environments is required.}

\item{n_traits}{Number of traits to be simulated.}

\item{mean}{A vector of mean genetic values for each environment-within-trait combination.
If only one value is specified, all environment-within-trait combinations will be assigned
the same mean.}

\item{var}{A vector of genetic variances for each trait. Simulated traits are restricted by the
compound symmetry model to having the same variance for each environment (i.e., main
effect variance + GxE interaction variance) and the same covariance between each pair of
environments (main effect variance). \cr
\strong{Note:} When \code{useVarA = TRUE} is specified in 'AlphaSimR' (default) the values in
\code{var} represent the \code{additive} genetic variances, otherwise they will represent the
\code{total} (additive + non-additive) genetic variances.}

\item{rel_main_eff_A}{A vector defining the magnitude of the additive main effect variance
relative to the additive main effect + GxE interaction variance for each trait. If only one
value is specified, all traits will be assigned the same relative magnitude. \cr
\strong{Note:} \code{0 < rel_main_eff_A < 1}.}

\item{cor_A}{A matrix of additive genetic correlations between traits. By default, a diagonal
matrix is constructed.}

\item{mean_DD}{A vector of mean dominance degrees for each environment-within-trait combination
(similar to \code{mean}). If only one value is specified, all environment-within-trait
combinations will be assigned the same mean. By default, \code{mean_DD = NULL} and dominance
is not simulated.}

\item{var_DD}{A vector of dominance degree variances for each trait. Simulated traits have the
same dominance degree variance for each environment and the same dominance degree covariance
between each pair of environments (similar to \code{var}).}

\item{rel_main_eff_DD}{A vector defining the magnitude of the dominance degree main effect
variance relative to the main effect + GxE interaction variance for each trait (similar to
\code{rel_main_eff_A}). If only one value is specified, all traits will be assigned the same
relative magnitude. \cr
\strong{Note:} \code{0 < rel_main_eff_DD < 1}.}

\item{cor_DD}{A matrix of dominance degree correlations between traits (similar
to \code{cor_A}). If not specified and dominance is simulated, a diagonal matrix is constructed.}

\item{rel_AA}{A vector defining the magnitude of additive-by-additive (epistatic) variance
relative to the additive genetic variance for each trait, that is in a diploid organism with
allele frequency 0.5. Simulated traits have the same epistatic variance for each environment
and the same epistatic covariance between each pair of environments (similar to \code{var}).
If only one value is specified, all traits will be assigned the same relative magnitude.}

\item{rel_main_eff_AA}{A vector defining the magnitude of the epistatic main effect variance
relative to the main effect + GxE interaction variance for each trait (similar to
\code{rel_main_eff_A}). If only one value is specified, all traits will be assigned the
same relative magnitude. \cr
\strong{Note:} \code{0 < rel_main_eff_AA < 1}.}

\item{cor_AA}{A matrix of epistatic correlations between traits (similar to
\code{cor_A}). If not specified and epistasis is simulated, a diagonal matrix is constructed.}

\value{
A list containing input parameters for 'AlphaSimR', which is used to simulate
  correlated genetic effects based on a compound symmetry model.
}
\description{
Creates a list of input parameters for
\href{https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=AlphaSimR}{'AlphaSimR'} to simulate
genetic values for multiple traits across multiple environments based on a compound symmetry
model for genotype-by-environment (GxE) interaction. \cr
By default, 'AlphaSimR' does not support complex models for GxE interaction. However, its
functionality to simulate correlated genetic values can be utilised for this purpose by
providing the required variance structures. \code{compsym_asr_input} is a wrapper function to
construct the variance structures required to simulate GxE interaction in 'AlphaSimR' based on
a multi-trait compound symmetry model. This function assumes a separable structure between
traits and environments. After simulating the genetic values, the wrapper function
\link[FieldSimR]{compsym_asr_output} can be used to obtain data frames with the values.
}
\details{
\strong{Note:} 'AlphaSimR' can simulate different biological effects (see:
\href{https://gaynorr.github.io/AlphaSimR/reference/SimParam.html}{SimParam}).
\itemize{
  \item For additive traits use \code{addTraitA()}.
  \item For additive + dominance traits use \code{addTraitAD()}.
  \item For additive + epistatic traits use \code{addTraitAE()}.
  \item For additive + dominance + epistatic traits use \code{addTraitADE()}.
  }
If non-additive effects are to be simulated, check the \code{useVarA} argument of these
functions.
